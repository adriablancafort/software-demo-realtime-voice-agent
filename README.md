## üöÄ Features

- **Real-Time Interaction**: Instant responses and actions based on voice input
- **Customizable Experience**: Easily adapt to your SaaS application
- **Seamless Browser Automation**: Powered by Playwright for reliable web interactions

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works

This Voice Agent Architecture is split into 3 different layers:

### 1. Speech-to-Text (STT) Layer üé§
- **Provider**: Deepgram
- Converts user's spoken words into text in real-time
- Handles various accents and speech patterns with high accuracy
- **Voice Activity Detection**: Uses SileroVADAnalyzer for intelligent endpointing and turn detection

### 2. Large Language Model (LLM) Layer üß†
- **Provider**: OpenAI (GPT-4)
- The brain of the operation where all the logic happens
- Processes user requests, understands context, and decides on actions
- Makes intelligent tool calls to navigate and interact with the application

### 3. Text-to-Speech (TTS) Layer üîä
- **Provider**: Cartesia
- Converts AI responses back into natural-sounding speech
- Uses advanced voice synthesis for a professional, engaging experience

### Browser Automation üåê
- **Technology**: Playwright
- Handles all web interactions, navigation, and UI manipulations
- Includes visual cursor animations for a polished demo experience

## üé® Customization for Your SaaS

To adapt this agent for your own SaaS application:

1. **Update Prompts**: Modify the prompts in `custom/prompts.py` to match your application's context and use cases
2. **Configure Selectors**: Update the CSS selectors in `custom/selectors.py` to target the specific elements in your web application

The agent uses tool calls to perform actions like:
- Navigating between pages
- Clicking on elements
- Typing into input fields
- Scrolling the page

Simply update the selectors and prompts to point to your application's UI elements and workflows.
